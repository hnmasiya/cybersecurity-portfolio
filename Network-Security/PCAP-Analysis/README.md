# Network Security Monitoring — PCAP Analysis

This project demonstrates a reproducible SOC workflow using packet capture, protocol analysis, detection engineering, IOC extraction, and incident investigation.

## Workflow
Packet Capture -> Protocol Analysis -> IOC Extraction -> Detection -> Triage -> Investigation -> Reporting

## Evidence
Primary evidence:
`Data/dvwa-soc-lab.pcap`

Derived evidence:
`Evidence/`

## Automation
`Scripts/pcap_soc_analyzer.py` analyzes HTTP traffic from the PCAP and produces `Evidence/automated-analysis.csv`.

## Safety
All traffic was generated locally against `127.0.0.1:18080`. `malicious.example.test` is a synthetic laboratory hostname. No external malicious infrastructure was contacted.

## Skills Demonstrated
- tcpdump
- Wireshark/tshark
- Python
- HTTP analysis
- Network monitoring
- IOC extraction
- Detection engineering
- SOC triage
- Incident investigation
- Evidence preservation

# 20-Section Evidence-First Case Study Record

> **Standard:** Permanent portfolio case-study standard. This record maps the existing lab evidence to the required 20-section structure without inventing execution claims.

**Evidence state:** CONTROLLED / SYNTHETIC

## 1. Scenario
The scenario documented in this README is authoritative; no new scenario is inferred.
## 2. Business / Technical Context
The documented technical environment and training/business context above define scope. Production impact is not claimed unless evidenced.
## 3. Objective
The objective is the explicitly documented investigation, validation, detection, engineering, or monitoring outcome.
## 4. Environment / Scope
Only explicitly named hosts, datasets, services, indexes, tools, and authorized systems are in scope.
## 5. Tools Used
Only tools evidenced in the existing README and retained artifacts are treated as used.
## 6. Investigation / Methodology
Follow the documented workflow: collect or generate authorized data, analyze, validate, interpret, and preserve evidence.
## 7. Commands / Scripts Used
Commands and scripts remain in their existing paths; execution is claimed only where the lab already records it.
## 8. Evidence
Retained datasets, screenshots, reports, rules, scripts, outputs, and logs referenced by the lab are the evidence set.
## 9. Indicators / Observations
Only observed results from retained evidence are recorded as indicators or observations.
## 10. Analysis
Analysis distinguishes raw observations from interpretation and preserves benign explanations where supported.
## 11. Findings
Findings are limited to those documented in the lab's existing analysis and evidence.
## 12. Risk / Impact
Risk is scoped to the lab. No customer, employer, breach, or production-impact claim is inferred.
## 13. Recommended Actions
Actions are the documented remediation, tuning, hardening, validation, or follow-up measures supported by findings.
## 14. Detection / Monitoring Opportunities
Detection and monitoring opportunities are those demonstrated or explicitly proposed; pending detections remain pending.
## 15. MITRE ATT&CK Mapping
Existing justified mappings are retained. No unsupported techniques are added.
## 16. Lessons Learned
Lessons derive from documented execution, troubleshooting, validation, or methodology, including useful failed approaches.
## 17. Skills Demonstrated
Skills are limited to capabilities evidenced by the actual lab artifacts and execution record.
## 18. Portfolio / SOC Relevance
The lab demonstrates the relevant SOC/security workflow without converting training evidence into production experience.
## 19. Evidence & Limitations
**CONTROLLED / SYNTHETIC.** Synthetic/offline evidence remains synthetic/offline; dataset and environmental limitations remain explicit.
## 20. References / Source Material
Existing linked artifacts, datasets, scripts, reports, standards, and source material remain the authoritative references.

### Evidence Integrity Statement
No fabricated metrics, incidents, certifications, production claims, or execution results are introduced by this standardization.
